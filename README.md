# Golden Rose App - in process, currently updating my API and will add soon, then refactor

https://golden-rose.herokuapp.com/

### On search page type "CAKE" || "DONUTS" || "CHOCOLATE"

Used:

1. React
2. Redux
3. Custom API (currently being updated, so old API inserted).

### It has 4 pages, but payment page will open once you put something in cart and press order now

#### Some hardcoded values (date) + small direct DOM manipulation (later to change with state) + needs to be refactored, still in process

Halfway completed, but the most important features are implemented:

Items are searchable, menu is created dynamically, items can be added to cart and liked, page switcher implemented.

Still to do: payment page and fix some design issues on search page.
