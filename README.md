## npm run server - otherwise no pictures will show

At the moment still has API from mealmaker, new API coming (will be very simple).

### On search page type "CAKE" || "DONUTS" || "CHOCOLATE"

Used:

1. React
2. Redux
3. Custom API (currently being updated, so old API inserted).

https://elegant-lumiere-7bbabc.netlify.app/# --- only for outline design, as server with data isn't yet hosted, I will upload heroku later

### It has 4 pages, but payment page will open once you put something in cart and press order now

#### Some hardcoded values (date) + small direct DOM manipulation (later to change with state) + needs to be refactored, still in process

Used the same API as for MealMaker (as for now)

Halfway completed, but the most important features are implemented:

Items are searchable, menu is created dynamically, items can be added to cart and liked, page switcher implemented.

- Ingredients not working on cart page, as ingredietns from API are not structured as I want them to be, so added random markup.

Still to do: payment page and fix some design issues on search page.
